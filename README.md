Welcome to my 90 Days of SQL challenge!
Over the next 90 days, I’ll be solving one or more intermediate to advanced SQL problems each day to sharpen my data querying skills, improve analytical thinking, and build consistency. This repository will serve as a daily log of my learning, growth, and problem-solving journey.

📌 What to Expect
📅 Daily Practice: One or more SQL questions solved per day for 90 consecutive days

💡 Problem Types: Joins, subqueries, window functions, CTEs, aggregations, advanced filtering, optimization techniques, etc.

🛠️ Tools Used: MySQL

📁 Organized Structure: Solutions categorized by topics and difficulty (First 45 days intermediate level questions and next 45 days I will focus on advanced level questions.)

🧠 Reflections & Notes: Short explanation or thought process (where applicable)

🎯 Goal
To become fluent in SQL for data analytics and data science roles by building hands-on experience with real-world query challenges.
